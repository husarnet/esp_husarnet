# Husarnet Webserver Example

This example demonstrates how to use the Husarnet library to join a Husarnet network and start a web server.

Replace `/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` with your join code from the [Husarnet Dashboard](https://app.husarnet.com/). You can also set your device name in the `husarnet_join` function.

Run `idf.py menuconfig` and set your WiFi SSID and password in the `Example Connection Configuration` section.

Using a client with Husarnet installed, you can access the web server by navigating to [http://husarnet-esp32](http://husarnet-esp32) in your web browser.
